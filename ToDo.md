## ToDo ##
  * keep the modification history of cc\_config.xml and enable restoring to a specified previous version (muclemanxb@equn)
  * improve the manipulation of exclusive\_app and exclusive\_gpu\_app rather than manually editing(`Wayne_Chang@equn`)
  * show individual help infomation on every option control (DrLingCN@equn)

## Known Bugs ##
  * The Help button doesn't display correctly at first (when system theme is disabled)
  * Those three menu buttons doesn't show up at all sometimes:
    1. press win+d to show the desktop
    1. run the program's shortcut on the desktop
